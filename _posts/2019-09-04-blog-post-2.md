Those late night talks,<br/>
those silly silly thoughts,<br/>
those emotional supports<br/>
and the right words told.<br/>
<br/>
The scoldings of friend<br/>
when you are slacking away,<br/>
and those holding of hands<br/>
when something's lacking away.<br/>
<br/>
Your unbearable attitudes<br/>
that they bear with a smile,<br/>
those childishness in you<br/>
which they try to keep alive.<br/>
<br/>
Those moments, that you look<br/>
at them pass away.<br/>
The roads of your life<br/>
will slowly divert their way.<br/>
<br/>
Check out, what's currently<br/>
in your everyday weather,<br/>
will soon become a<br/>
desirable and rare treasure.<br/>
<br/>
So collect the treasures,<br/>
while you can still do.<br/>
Cause when you are lonely,<br/>
They'll be there with you.<br/><br/>
