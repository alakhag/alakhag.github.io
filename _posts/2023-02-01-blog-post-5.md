The rendering equation, along a view-direction $o$ from camera, is defined as follows:

$$R(o) = \int_{S^2} L(i) V(i) \rho_o(i) max(0, i.n) di$$

This rendering equation gives the final rendered color for a surface point $x$, illuminated by one or more light sources.

Here, $i$ is the incident light direction.

So, $L(i)$ defines direct illumination from light, $V(i)$ determines if the visibility of the light source, $\rho_o(i)$ is the Bidirection Radial Distribution Function (BRDF) that determines the albedo, diffuse and specularity, and $i.n$ gives the cosine angle between the surface and incident light direction.

Note, in this equation, we use $max(0, i.n)$ to only sample incident lights from positive hemisphere towards the surface normal.
