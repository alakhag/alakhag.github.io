Those late night talks,
those silly silly thoughts,
those emotional supports
and the right words told.
The scoldings of friend
when you are slacking away,
and those holding of hands
when something's lacking away.
Your unbearable attitudes
that they bear with a smile,
those childishness in you
which they try to keep alive.
Those moments, that you look
at them pass away.
The roads of your life
will slowly divert their way.
Check out, what's currently
in your everyday weather,
will soon become a
desirable and rare treasure.
So collect the treasures,
while you can still do.
Cause when you are lonely,
They'll be there with you.
