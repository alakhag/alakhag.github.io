Welcome to my Website! I am really glad that you are here, and hope that you can make the most out of it. I will be updating my profile and information and maintain it, along with writing about latest research in my field. I hope this keeps me up-to-date with latest works, and simultaneously, can be helpful for others.

Hope you like it! Shoot your comments, suggestions and thoughts at <alakh.aggarwal@utdallas.edu>.
