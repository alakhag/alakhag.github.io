I am a **researcher** and an aspiring **computer scientist**, deeply passionate about **3D Vision** and its applications. Currently, I am pursuing a **Ph.D. in Computer Science** at [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://utdallas.edu/), where I focus on **Implicit 3D Graphics and Scene Reconstruction** under the guidance of [Dr. Xiaohu Guo](https://www.utdallas.edu/~xguo/).  

## Education & Research Journey  

My journey in research began during my undergraduate studies in **Computer Science and Engineering** at [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://iitbhu.ac.in/cse/), which I completed in **2019**. During this time, I explored multiple research directions, collaborating with esteemed professors and researchers:

- **[Dr. Pratik Chattopadhyay](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/pratikcse)** – Worked on **Broad Learning Systems**, **De-identification**, and various applications of **Neural Networks** and **Computer Vision**.  
- **[Dr. Shankar M. Venkatesan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=HFm0RpIAAAAJ)** – Developed a **Lip-Reading System** at **Samsung R&D Institute, Bangalore**.  
- **[Dr. Ravi S. Hegde](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/faculty/electrical/ravi.htm)** – Researched **Object Detection Feature Transfer** from synthetic images to real-world images at **IIT Gandhinagar**.  

These experiences have shaped my perspective on **computer vision, machine learning, and 3D graphics**, motivating me to explore new frontiers in **3D reconstruction and implicit representations** in my Ph.D. research.

## Gratitude & Vision  

I am deeply grateful to my advisors and collaborators who have mentored and inspired me throughout my journey. Their guidance has shaped my understanding and passion for research.  

My goal is to leverage my expertise to **advance vision technologies** and contribute meaningfully to the world. True to my name, **Alakh**—derived from Sanskrit, meaning *that which cannot be perceived by the naked eye*—I aspire to uncover **visual information beyond what meets the eye**, pushing the boundaries of perception and understanding in computer vision.

## Personal Background  

I grew up in **Chandigarh** and **New Delhi**, India. My curiosity for technology and problem-solving has driven me to push boundaries in research and innovation. I strive to keep learning, exploring, and making a positive impact.
